# Overview

*This MySQL project is used to perform data analysis with some Methods to Predict the Outcome (1 = "Patient with Diabetes" and 0 = "Patient without Diabetes") effected by Glucose, Age, Pregnancies*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data and Exploration

### - Dataset <br />

The database **`health care diabetes`** is created using SQL. <br />
The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. <br />
There are 9 tables : *Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age, Outcome*. <br />

### - Variables <br />

**The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and more.**

- Pregnancies : Number of times pregnant
- Glucose Plasma : glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure : Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness : Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- Insulin : Two hour serum insulin
- BMI : Body Mass Index
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction : Diabetes pedigree function
- Age : Age in years
- Outcome : Class variable (either 0 or 1). 268 of 768 values are 1, and the others are 0

## - Exploration Question <br />

**The following questions are explored :**

- The most patient has diabetes by age
- Average pregnancy by age
- Distribution of each variabels
- Probability of Pregnancies got a child with diabetes
- Information of patients by several medical predictor variabels
